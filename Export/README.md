# Scope

In analogy of the the [CRAN task view
lists](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/), this list is a collection
of freely available software for the broader framework trapped charged
dating (e.g., luminescence and ESR data analysis). Software tools are
ordered alphabetically within the task sections.

## How to contribute?

# Data analysis tasks

### Age calculation

  - **DRAC**: Dose rate and luminescence age calculator (v1.2 | Windows,
    Linux, macOS) <br /> URL:
    <http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/dges/research/quaternary/luminescence-research-laboratory/dose-rate-calculator/>
    <br />*<small>Durcan, J.A., King, G.E., Duller, G.A.T., 2015. DRAC:
    Dose Rate and Age Calculator for trapped charge dating. Quaternary
    Geochronology 28, 54–61. doi:
    <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quageo.2015.03.012></small>*

### Chronological modelling

  - **ArchaeoChron**: Provides a list of functions for the Bayesian
    modeling of archaeological chronologies. The Bayesian models are
    implemented in ‘JAGS’ (‘JAGS’ stands for Just Another Gibbs Sampler.
    It is a program for the analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models
    using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. See
    <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/> and “JAGS Version 4.3.0 user
    manual”, Martin Plummer (2017)
    <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/Manuals/>.). The
    inputs are measurements with their associated standard deviations
    and the study period. The output is the MCMC sample of the posterior
    distribution of the event date with or without radiocarbon
    calibration. (v0.1 | Windows, Linux, macOS) <br /> URL:
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ArchaeoChron> <br />
  - **ArchaeoPhases**: Provides a list of functions for the statistical
    analysis of archaeological dates and groups of dates. It is based on
    the post-processing of the Markov Chains whose stationary
    distribution is the posterior distribution of a series of dates.
    Such output can be simulated by different applications as for
    instance ‘ChronoModel’ (see <http://www.chronomodel.fr>), ‘Oxcal’
    (see <https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html>) or ‘BCal’ (see
    <http://bcal.shef.ac.uk/>). The only requirement is to have a csv
    file containing a sample from the posterior distribution. (v1.3 |
    Windows, Linux, macOS) <br /> URL:
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ArchaeoPhases> <br />
  - **BayLum**: Bayesian analysis of luminescence data and C-14 age
    estimates. Bayesian models are based on the following publications:
    Combes, B. & Philippe, A. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.quageo.2017.02.003>
    and Combes et al (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.quageo.2015.04.001>. This
    includes, amongst others, data import, export, application of age
    models and palaeodose model. (v0.1.3 | Windows, Linux, macOS) <br />

    model in a Bayesian framework. Its output is a sampled Markov chain
    from the posterior distribution of dates component the chronology.
    The functions can also be applied to the analyse of mcmc output
    generated by Oxcal software. (v0.4 | Windows, Linux, macOS) <br />
